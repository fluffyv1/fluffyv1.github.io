you obtain through the App stores or obtain through our website, where
applicable, is subject to your prior acceptance of this EULA. You are, on
purchase from the App store, entering into a binding agreement directly
with the Licensor of the software and not the App store. The App store is at

The Licensor of each App is solely responsible for that App including any
warranties and claims that you may have relating to that third party App
product.
2.2 The Licensee is granted a non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable
licence to use the App on a mobile device for your own business and/or
your own private and non-commercial purposes and in accordance with the
provisions of this clause.
2.3 Subject to the payment by the Licensee of the relevant charges and

Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence
to:
(a) download the Software;

(b) install the Software on one mobile device provided that only the single
authorised licence holder will operate the products. A single licence does

for use by more than one user; and

2.4 The Licensee must not:
(a) copy or reproduce the Software or any part of the Software other than in

the Software; or

technological measures applied to the Software for the purposes of
preventing unauthorised use;
provided that nothing in this clause will prohibit or restrict the Licensee or
any other person from doing any act expressly permitted by applicable law.
2.5 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Software are and will remain, as
between the parties, the property of the Licensor. In the event of any
dispute of Intellectual Property Rights, the Licensor retains and has full
rights solely for any investigation, defence, settlement and discharge of any
such claim by any third party.
2.6 The Licensee must not permit any other person to use the Software or
to exercise any of the other rights granted by the Licensor to the Licensee
in this EULA.

<h3>3. SUPPORT</h3>
3.1 The Licensor is solely responsible for providing support and
maintenance for the App subject to the following:
(a) The Licensee must promptly apply any Software Upgrade released by

under this clause or repair or replace the Software in relation to any version
of the Software that does not incorporate the most recent upgrade to the
Software; where the problem arises from Software not supplied by and or
any unauthorised use or modification of the Software; and
(c) The Licensor will provide to the Licensee email support during the
period of the licence for the purpose of resolving issues with the Software
raised by the Licensee acting reasonably. At no time does the Licensor
warrant that the Software will be virus-free and the Licensor agrees it is
solely the Licensor’s responsibility to conduct appropriate virus scanning
prior to the installation and use of any Software.
3.2 The Licensee acknowledges that:
(a) the Licensor’s sole obligation under the clause is to make reasonable
endeavours to resolve issues raised by the Licensee;
(b) the Licensor does not warrant or represent that issues raised will be
solved by means of the support services;
(c) the Licensor will not provide any on-site support under this EULA; and
(d) the Licensor and not the App store, is solely responsible for all
maintenance and support of the App.
3.3 The Licensor may subcontract any of its obligations under this clause to
any third party.

uninterrupted or error-free. There may be periods where, for technical or
operational reasons the App and services may be inaccessible or that we
may have to cancel the service as a result of the technical or operational
issues. Non-material errors in the Software will not constitute a breach of
this EULA; and

(b) that the App, Software and services will be free from loss, viruses,
corruption, hacking, security breaches or other such events which may
constitute a Force Majeure Event for which we disclaim any liability for any
such issue or event. You are solely responsible for backing up your
systems, information and software.
4.3 All of the parties’ liabilities and obligations in respect of the subject
matter of this EULA are expressly set out herein. To the maximum extent

matter of the EULA, including liabilities arising in contract, in tort (including
negligence) and for breach of statutory duty.
4.5 The Licensor will not be liable to the Licensee in respect of any
business or personal losses, such as loss of or damage to profits, income,
revenue, use, production, anticipated savings, business, contracts,
commercial opportunities, goodwill, Force Majeure Event, death or
personal injury.
4.6 The Licensor will at no time be liable to the Licensee in respect of any
special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage including but not limited
to any loss or corruption of any data, database or software. In any case, the
Licensor’s aggregate liability to the Licensee will not exceed the purchase
price of the App.
4.7 In the event of any issues with the App, the Licensor, and not the App
store or any of its affiliates, is responsible for addressing all claims relating
to any issues including but not limited to: the licence, any intellectual
property rights, use of the App, any issues relating to warranties, consumer
law and regulation and all other claims. You may notify the App store of any
issues or claims you may have but you acknowledge that the App store is
at no time responsible for any claim or rectification of any issue.

<h3>5. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
You agree to indemnify and hold us, each of our affiliates, successors,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, suppliers and service
providers harmless from and against any and all losses, expenses,
damages, costs and expenses (including all reasonable legal fees),
resulting from your use of the App and/or any violation of these Terms. You
agree to assume and take over control of any demand, claim or action
arising hereunder or connection with the App in the event of any action
resulting directly or indirectly from your use of the App or our Services or
any breach of the Terms.
<h3>6. TERMINATION</h3>
The licence granted under this EULA is effective until terminated either by
you or the Licensor. Your rights under this licence will terminate
automatically without notice from the Licensor if you fail to comply with any
terms of this licence. Upon termination of the licence, you will cease all use
of the App and destroy all copies of the App.
<h3>7. GENERAL</h3>
7.1 No breach of any provision of this EULA will be waived except with the
express written consent of the party not in breach.
7.2 If a clause of this EULA is determined by any court or other competent
authority to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the other clauses of this
EULA will continue in effect. If any unlawful and/or unenforceable clause
would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will be
deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the clause will continue in effect
(unless that would contradict the clear intention of the parties, in which
case the entirety of the relevant clause will be deemed to be deleted).
7.3 The Licensor may freely assign this EULA and/or its rights and/or
obligations under this EULA without the Licensee’s consent. Except as
expressly provided in this EULA, the Licensee must not assign, transfer,
charge, licence or otherwise dispose of or deal in this EULA and/or any its
rights and/or obligations under this EULA.

7.4 Where the App is listed on a third party app store, the app store is a
third party beneficiary of this EULA and has the right to enforce this EULA
against the Licensee.
7.5 Where the App uses or requires any third party service in order to run
or provide the App services, the Licensee agrees to comply with all relevant
third party agreements and terms.

the US Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) listed on any
US Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
7.8 EU resident’s right of withdrawal on software sales: European law
principally provides a right of withdrawal in respect of software sales that
can be excluded for digitally provided content. Therefore, if the End User is
domiciled in a country of the European Union (EU), the EU statutory right of
withdrawal ends 14 days after the purchase of the Software or the moment
the End User start downloading the Software for the first time (whichever is
sooner).
7.9 This EULA will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State or Territory of Victoria, Australia; and the courts of the
State or Territory of Victoria, Australia, will have exclusive jurisdiction to
adjudicate any dispute arising under or in connection with this EULA.
